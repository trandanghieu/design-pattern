## design-pattern
### 1.Singleton
      Singleton is a design solution where an application wants to have once and only
      one instance of any class.
### 2.Factory 
      Factory is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object
      to be created. Instead of using a constructor to create an object, a method 
      (commonly called a "factory method") is employed toinstantiate the object.
### 3.Builder
      Builder is a design solution that alows for the step-by-step creationof complex objects
      using the correct sequence of actions.
### 4.Strategy
      The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms,
      encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern lets the algorithm
      vary independently from clients that use it.
