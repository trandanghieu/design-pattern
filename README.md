## design-pattern
### 1.Singleton
      Singleton is a design solution where an application wants to have once and only one instance of any class.
### 2.Factory 
      Factory is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. Instead of using a constructor to create an object, a method (commonly called a "factory method") is employed to instantiate the object.
### 3.Builder
      Builder is a design solution that alows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions.
